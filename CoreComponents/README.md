The program takes user input using a TextInput, allowing students to type their favorite MSCS course. The app uses static data information for core courses, depth of study courses, and the capstone course. The CoreComponents functional component manages the input using React’s useState hook, updating the favorite course as the user types. Each course is listed using <Text> element inside <View> containers. The <ScrollView> ensures all content remains visible even when the list exceeds the screen height. The output is a scrollable mobile screen, the header with an icon, the favorite course entered by the user and the list of courses. Elements are styled through a StyleSheet for layout.
