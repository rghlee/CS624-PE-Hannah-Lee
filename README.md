The HelloWorld displays the name, degree program and school on the screen. This is fixed information directly written into the program and does not involve external data sources. When the app runs, React Native displays the HelloWorldScreen. The container View has three Text elements (name, degree program, school). The Stylesheet defines the visual properties such as font size, margin and backgroun color of the container. The program outputs a visual display of user's information on the device screen. The container's background is yellow and the text is centered vertically and horizontally.
